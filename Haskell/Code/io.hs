{-
	Actions are sequenced using an operator that has a rather cryptic name: >>= (or `bind').
	Instead of using this operator directly, we choose some syntactic sugar, the do notation,
	to hide these sequencing operators under a syntax resembling more conventional languages.
	The do notation can be trivially expanded to >>=.
